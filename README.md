A Twitter-responsive Christmas Tree (different coloured LEDs light up depending on what words are tweeted by people)

The program and setup are based on this tutorial by James Bruce: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-build-a-raspberry-pi-twitter-bot/  
(although this particular program doesn't need to post to a twitter account).
