A Twitter-responsive Christmas Tree (different coloured LEDs light up depending on what words are tweeted by people)

The setup of the twitter connection (using Twython) is based on this tutorial by James Bruce: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-build-a-raspberry-pi-twitter-bot/  
(although this particular program doesn't need to post to a twitter account).

The LEDs are wired up to the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi as follows: http://glasgow.coderdojo.co/christmastree/xmastreeCircuit_colours_numbers.png
